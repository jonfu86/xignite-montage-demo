It maps server data to model objects accessible in\napplication code, allowing complex server operations to be performed by reading\nand writing the properties of model objects obtained with simple queries and\nby traversing relationships.\n\nMontage Data is an Object Service Mapping (OSM), something like an Object\nRelational Mapping (ORM) that works for servers offering REST and other types\nof non-relational services.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be generated by installing JSDoc 3.3.3 or newer and executing\n`jsdoc -c .jsdoc.conf.json` in the root of the project, and it can be read by\nopening the resulting `out/doc/index.html` in a web browser.\n\n## Testing\n\nAll non-disabled tests should always pass.\n\nTests can be run by executing `npm install` in the `test` subdirectory and then\nloading `test/run.html` through a web server. Tests can be created by editing\n`test/run.js`.\n",
